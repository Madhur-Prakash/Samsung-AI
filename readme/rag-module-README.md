# RAG Query Module

## Overview

The RAG Query Module powers ListenIQ with offline, privacy-first semantic search and context-aware response generation. By combining locally stored vector embeddings with an on-device LLM, it enables users to query and retrieve insights directly from their captured speech and action history—ensuring responses are accurate, contextual, and fully private without relying on external servers.

## Core Components

The system is architected around four primary components that work in tandem to deliver intelligent, context-aware responses while maintaining strict privacy and efficiency standards. Each component is optimized for edge deployment, ensuring low-latency processing without cloud dependencies.

---

## 1. Vector Database Search

The foundation of contextual retrieval lies in efficient semantic search capabilities implemented through a hybrid local database architecture.

- **Database Architecture**: Utilizes SQLite as the primary storage layer with custom extensions for vector operations, providing ACID compliance and efficient indexing. The system implements FAISS-like functionality through optimized vector similarity algorithms, supporting cosine similarity, dot product, and Euclidean distance metrics for flexible matching strategies.

- **Semantic Embedding Engine**: Employs the **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model converted to TensorFlow Lite format (TFLite) for on-device semantic encoding. This 22MB model generates 384-dimensional embeddings with minimal computational overhead, achieving inference speeds of <50ms per query on mobile processors. The model excels at understanding semantic relationships between user queries and stored context.

- **Vector Operations**: Performs efficient vector similarity searches using cosine similarity and top-k retrieval techniques. This ensures responses are context-aware, accurate, and privacy-preserving, while supporting parallel queries for smooth, real-time interaction.

- **Storage Optimization**: Features automatic embedding deletion after a **30 days** to avoid stale data and dynamic index rebuilding to maintain search performance as data grows.

---

## 2. Context Retrieval Engine

This component intelligently identifies and assembles relevant contextual information to inform response generation.

- **Multi-Modal Retrieval**: Fetches semantically related chunks from diverse data sources including speech transcriptions and system event logs.

- **Context Filtering**: Implements multi-layered filtering to ensure response quality: removes duplicate or near-duplicate content using tokenization, filters out low-confidence matches below configurable thresholds, and applies content-type specific filters to maintain contextual coherence.

- **Chunk Assembly**: Optimizes context window usage by intelligently truncating and combining retrieved chunks. Preserves essential context markers (timestamps, speaker identification, emotional indicators) while maximizing information density within token limits.

---

## 3. Prompt Construction Module

Transforms raw retrieved context into structured, optimized prompts that maximize LLM performance while maintaining privacy boundaries.

- **Template System**: Utilizes a prompt templates that helps to structure user queries into a coherent format, ensuring all relevant context is included.

- **Privacy Protection**: Implements comprehensive data sanitization removing personally identifiable information (PII) using named entity recognition, replacing sensitive data with anonymized placeholders, and applying configurable privacy levels based on user preferences. Maintains detailed audit logs of privacy operations for transparency.

- **Prompt Optimization**: Employs token-efficient encoding strategies to maximize context utilization, implements dynamic compression for lengthy contexts, and uses prompt engineering techniques like few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting to improve response quality.

---

## 4. LLM Processing

The inference engine handles on-device language model execution with optimizations for mobile deployment.

- **Model Architecture**: Uses quantized transformer models converted to TensorFlow Lite.

- **Context-Aware Generation**: Strictly constrains response generation to provided context using attention masking and logit biasing techniques.

- **Response Quality Control**: Monitors output for coherence using perplexity scoring, implements safety filtering to prevent inappropriate content generation, and provides confidence scoring for generated responses. Features graceful degradation when context is insufficient, providing transparent uncertainty indicators to users.

## Technical Implementation

### Semantic Search & Embedding Retrieval
```dart
// Vector search logic
Future<List<VectorSearchResult>> search(List<double> queryEmbedding, {int topK = 5}) async {
    // Calculate cosine similarities
    final results = <VectorSearchResult>[];
    
    for (final entry in _entries) {
      final similarity = _cosineSimilarity(queryEmbedding, entry.embedding);
      results.add(VectorSearchResult(
        id: entry.id,
        text: entry.text,
        metadata: entry.metadata,
        similarity: similarity,
      ));
    }

    // Sort by similarity (descending) and take top K
    results.sort((a, b) => b.similarity.compareTo(a.similarity));
    
    return results.take(topK).toList();
  }

  double _cosineSimilarity(List<double> a, List<double> b) {
    if (a.length != b.length) {
      throw ArgumentError('Vector dimensions must match');
    }

    double dotProduct = 0.0;
    double normA = 0.0;
    double normB = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
      dotProduct += a[i] * b[i];
      normA += a[i] * a[i];
      normB += b[i] * b[i];
    }

    if (normA == 0.0 || normB == 0.0) {
      return 0.0;
    }
    return dotProduct / (sqrt(normA) * sqrt(normB));
  }
```

### Prompt Structuring & LLM Integration
```dart
class PromptBuilder {
  static String buildPrompt(List<ResultChunk> chunks, String userQuery) {
    final context = chunks.map((c) => c.text).join("\n");
    final ragPrompt = """
      Please answer only using the context if missing say "The context doesn't contain the answer to your question."
      Context: $cleanedContext
      Question: $userQuery
      Answer:
    """;
    return ragPrompt;
  }
}

---

class LLMEngine {
  final Interpreter llmModel;

  Future<String> generateAnswer(String prompt, {int maxGenLen = 32}) async {
    // Tokenization and input preparation logic here
    // ...

    // Run inference
  }
}
```
